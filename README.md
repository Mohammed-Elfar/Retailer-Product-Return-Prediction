# Retailer Product Return Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a purchased product will be returned by a customer. By analyzing historical sales and return data, the model helps retailers identify high-risk transactions and reduce return-related costs.
Ideal for improving inventory management and customer satisfaction


## Approach & Steps:

1- Understanding the data variables: This step is important because it allows you to understand the meaning of each variable and how it might be related to the dependent variable

2- checked if the data types were correct and didnâ€™t need changes, then looked for missing or repeated data.

3- Univariate analysis:  In this step i will go through each column and fix problems , look at the distribution of each variable and do Eda for features to understand

4- Creating new features: This step allows you to create new features that are based on the existing features. This can be helpful if you want to improve the accuracy of your model.

5- Identifying the most important variables using diff tests: This step allows you to identify the variables that have the biggest impact on the dependent variable 

6- Pipeline Building: A pipeline was created to handle preprocessing, feature engineering, and model integration, ensuring a smooth and consistent workflow for training.

7- Model Building: The model building process utilized a pipeline and cross-validation to train and test multiple models and choose best model, ensuring no data leakage and  effective model. A pipeline was established to preprocess data and integrate various models, maintaining a consistent workflow.

8- Tuning: The model using fold cross-validation and grid search to optimize hyperparameters, achieving high accuracy and recall for deployment.
